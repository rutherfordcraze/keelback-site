# Keelback (Partial)

Keelback is a tiny, pure Python wiki-like implementation designed for my personal website. This repo is a mostly-complete example of the setup I use for that site, with a few non-public pages removed from the lexicon.

---

The site is deployed on [Zeit's](https://zeit.co) Now serverless platform (hence a few files specific to that).
